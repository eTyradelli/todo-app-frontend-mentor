## Overview

Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Eleana and I'm a Junior Frontend Developer from Greece.

This is my solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

This was the most JS-heavy project I've worked on yet, so I spent most of time to get things to work. I used local storage to give the user the opportunity to save their preferences. I also used the drag and drop API and the audio API for some extra features.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Local Storage
- Drag and Drop API
- Audio API


### Continued development

Next update on this project will clean up the CSS and JS.
